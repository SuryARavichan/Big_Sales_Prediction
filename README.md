Big_Sales_Prediction_using_Random_Forest_Regressor



The objective of this project is to build a predictive model leveraging the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to accurately forecast sales figures for a retail or e-commerce business. The goal is to analyze historical sales data along with various influencing factors—such as product attributes, store characteristics, seasonal trends, and promotional activities—to generate reliable sales predictions. These insights will enable better decision-making, such as optimizing inventory management, improving marketing strategies, and enhancing sales forecasting accuracy, ultimately driving business growth and operational efficiency.
